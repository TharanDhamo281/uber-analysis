🚖 Uber Rides Predictor - Machine Learning Web App 🚀

I’m excited to share a recent project I completed as part of my journey into Data Science and Full-Stack Development!

🔍 Project Overview: I built a Machine Learning web application that predicts the number of weekly Uber riders in a region, based on key influencing factors like:

✅ Price per week

✅ City population

✅ Average monthly income

✅ Average parking cost per month

📊 Dataset: The dataset consisted of 27 rows of real-world-style data containing:

Clean numerical values (no nulls 🙌)

Features like Priceperweek, Population, Monthlyincome, and Averageparkingpermonth

Target variable: Numberofweeklyriders

🧠 ML Workflow:

Performed exploratory data analysis to understand trends & correlations.

Built and trained a regression model to predict the number of weekly riders.

Evaluated model performance with suitable metrics.

Deployed the model in a Flask Web Application with a clean, animated, responsive UI.

💻 Tech Stack:

Python

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (for ML)

Flask (for backend deployment)

HTML, CSS (for UI/UX)

✨ The UI is dynamic and responsive, complete with animations and gradient transitions to offer a real-world product feel.

🔗 This project helped me understand the complete ML deployment lifecycle, from dataset analysis to a live working app!

🧑‍💻 Excited to keep learning and sharing more. Feedback is always welcome!
